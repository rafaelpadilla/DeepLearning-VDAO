# Detecting lost objects with Deep Learning

In this repository you can find my experiments using Deep Learning on VDAO database.

## VDAO Database ##

VDAO is a video database containing annotated videos in a cluttered industrial environment. The videos were captured using a camera on a moving platform.

The complete database comprises a total 6 multi-object, 56 single-object and 4 no-object (for reference purposes) footages, acquired with two different cameras and two different light conditions, yielding an approximate total of 8.2 hours of video. A total of 77 videos form the VDAO base. Those videos are grouped into tables according to configurations such as number of lost objects and illuminations.

See [here](http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~tvdigital/database/objects/docs/an_annotated_video_database_for_abandoned_object_detection_in_a_cluttered_environment.pdf) the paper presenting the database. You can download the database videos and related annotation files from the **[official VDAO database webpage](http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~tvdigital/database/objects/page_01.html)**.

Or if you prefer, you can download the videos and annotations directly from [here](VDAO.md). The links just point to the official distribution.

You can have a bunch of useful tools to play with VDAO database in the **[VDAO_Access Project](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/DeepLearning-VDAO/tree/master/VDAO_Access)**.

The images below show examples of **reference frames** (no object) and **target frames** (with objects to be detected).

### VDAO Alignment ###

As mentioned before, VDAO database has 77 videos divided into 10 tables. Each table (except the table 01) has one reference video and multiple videos containing lost objects. Some applications it is necessary to make temporal alignment between the target videos (with objects) and the reference videos.

Part of this project focused on performing temporal alignment of the target videos to their corresponding reference ones. The frames correspondences can be found [here](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/DeepLearning-VDAO/blob/master/VDAO_Alignment.md).

## YOLO ##

Yolo (You Only <del>Live</del> Look Once) is a real-time object detection and classification that obtained excellent results on the [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/pascal/VOC/). So far, yolo has two versions: **Yolo V1** and Yolo V2, also refered as **Yolo 9000**. Click on the image below to watch Yolo 9000's promo video.

The authors have created a website explaining how it works, how to use it and how to train yolo with your images. Check the references below:
