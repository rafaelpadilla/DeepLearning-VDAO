# Detecting lost objects with Deep Learning

In this repository you can find my experiments using Deep Learning on VDAO database.

## VDAO Database ##

VDAO is a video database containing annotated videos in a cluttered industrial environment. The videos were captured using a camera on a moving platform.

The complete database comprises a total 6 multi-object, 56 single-object and 4 no-object (for reference purposes) footages, acquired with two different cameras and two different light conditions, yielding an approximate total of 8.2 hours of video.

See [here](http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~tvdigital/database/objects/docs/an_annotated_video_database_for_abandoned_object_detection_in_a_cluttered_environment.pdf) the paper presenting the database.

[Here](http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~tvdigital/database/objects/page_01.html) you can have access to the database and its annotation file.
